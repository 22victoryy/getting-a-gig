Getting a Gig: A Guide
=============

# Introduction

Hey friends!
This is a guide for getting a gig in college as a tech major.  I just graduated this past school year with 10 job offers after having 5 internships throughout my four years of college.  You can do that, too.  Because you're great.

# Your Resume

Your resume is your sales pitch.  Your resume is the thing that gets your foot in the door.  So, there's a few things you should do (and not do) to make it awesome, like you.

### Make your name *BIG*.
Your name has to stand out from everything else, because you want it to be remembered.  Making it the biggest thing on the page is the easiest thing you can do to make that possible.  I've seen soooo many resumes where the name is at the top, but it's just bolded and centered and they expect that to be enough.  It's not.  

### Remove the objective.
Nobody looks at the objective.  Nobody.  I personally spoke to a bunch of recruiters from various companies and they all said that they never look at them.  Use that space to talk about projects you've done, activities you've done, etc.

### Remove irrelevant work experience.
I know that lifeguarding in high school was a good gig that helped you gain people skills and attention to detail.  But you're in tech.  That doesn't matter as much to tech companies.  Sorry, buddy.  I still think you're great with people.
