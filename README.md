Getting a Gig: A Guide
=============

# Introduction

Hey friends!
This is a guide for getting a gig in college as a tech major.  I just graduated this past school year with 10 job offers after having 5 internships throughout my four years of college.  You can do that, too.  Because you're great.

# Your Resume

Your resume is your personal summary sheet.  Your resume is the thing that gets your foot in the door.  So, there's a few things you should do (and not do) to make it as awesome as you are.

### Make your name **BIG.**
Your name has to stand out from everything else, because you want it to be remembered.  Making it the biggest thing on the page is the easiest thing you can do to make that possible.  I've seen soooo many resumes where the name is at the top, but it's just bolded and centered and they expect that to be enough.  It's not.  

### Remove the objective.
Nobody looks at the objective.  Nobody.  I personally spoke to a bunch of recruiters from various companies and they all said that they never look at them.  Use that space to talk about projects you've done, activities you've done, etc.

### Remove irrelevant information.
I know that lifeguarding in high school was a good gig that helped you gain people skills and attention to detail.  But you're in tech.  That doesn't matter as much to tech companies.  Sorry, buddy.  I still think you're great with people.
When you're a first semester freshman, it's okay to have old high school stuff on there, just because it's less likely that you have other things to put on your resume.  But as soon as you have a college GPA to work with, a club or two, and some volunteer experiences to replace that, do it.

### Include only certain personal information.
Companies aren't allowed to ask about your religion, marital status, or race/ethnicity, so you shouldn't include that.  

In terms of contact information: you don't need your mailing address.  That is a thing of the past.  Just like my youth.  Tech companies email, and **maybe** call.  That's all you need!
Some great things that you might also want to put on there are your personal website (if you have one, which you should), your GitHub profile (if you have one, which you should), and your LinkedIn (if you have one, which you should).

Though there's some who might disagree, you should **include your GPA.**  If your major GPA is significantly higher than your overall GPA, you might want to consider having both.  When you have graduated and have a full-time job, you won't need it as much.  But at this point in your beautiful life, keep it in there.  Some companies care about GPA more than others, so you might as well play it safe and have it there.

# Your Cover Letter

Your cover letter is your written sales pitch.  You've got a resume that summarizes everything.  Now you have to write out a more complete, professional description of you and what you can offer a given company.  Here's a sample cover letter to get you started:

```
Dear _________,

I hope your day is going well! My name is _________, and I'm a _________ at _________. I am very interested in working for _________ next _________. Your commitment to _________ and _________ that I saw on the website inspired me! The products you build and the values you stand for make _________ seem like an ideal workplace for me.
A little about me, I [insert relevant work experience, extracurriculars, and projects here]. I think these experiences would make me a great candidate for you.

Please let me know if there's anything else you need from me. I look forward to hearing from you! I can be reached at _________ and _________.

Best regards,
_________
```
Now, remember, this is just a sample.  You can write a cover letter in any format you'd like.  But, you should be sure to include the following:

- **Who** - Who you are.  Easy enough.
- **Where** - Where you're coming from.
- **Why** - Why you're interested in this company, and show that you researched them.
- **What** - What you can bring to the table.
- **When** - When you're available to start, and when they can contact you.
- **How** - How they can reach you.

# Your Attitude

When you're internship/job hunting, it's very easy to feel down if you don't hear back from companies, an interview goes poorly, or you start comparing yourself to people.  It's a tough field we're going into.

So.  I won't spend much time on this.  But I want to emphasize something: **You're brilliant.**  You're in this field for a reason.  When your grades aren't awesome or someone gets something that you wanted, don't feel down on yourself.  So many opportunities will come your way if you just keep working hard and refining your skills.

When you're talking to companies and recruiters at career fairs and hackathons and over the phone, be confident, not arrogant.  Be grateful for the opportunity they're giving you, and smile!  A great attitude will take you VERY far.

# Your Skills

Obviously, your skills are what a company is buying from you when they hire you.  So, honing in those skills and presenting them in an effective way is *probably* the most important thing in getting a gig.

## Building Them

Chances are, if you've had a data structures and/or algorithms class, you're already going to do pretty well in the technical interviews.  That is, if you can recall the information you learned.

Here's a checklist of things that you should probably be prepared to know in a technical interview:
- Data types
- Array
- Linked List
  - Singly Linked
  - Doubly Linked
  - Circular Linked
- Queue
- Stack
- Binary Tree
- Binary Search Tree
- Heap
- Graphs
- Sorting algorithms
  - Insertion
  - Selection
  - Merge
  - Quick
- Time Complexities

This guide isn't for teaching you these skills.  But there are several out there that can help.
- [Data Structures Questions](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-structures/)
- [Sorting Algorithms](http://www.sorting-algorithms.com/)
- [Big-O Cheat Sheet](http://bigocheatsheet.com/)
- [FitCoding](http://www.fitcoding.com/)
- [Google CodeJam Practice Questions](https://code.google.com/codejam/contests.html)
- [LeetCode Online Judge](https://oj.leetcode.com/problemset/algorithms/)
- [Data Structures and Algorithms Overview](http://www.dsalgo.com/2013/02/index.php.html?m=1)

Here's some books that might also be useful.
- [Algorithms, 4th edition, by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne](https://github.com/kasaquan/book/blob/master/Robert%20Sedgewick%20and%20Kevin%20Wayne%20-%20Algorithms%2C%204th%20edition.pdf)
- [Think Complexity, by Allen B. Downey](http://greenteapress.com/complexity/thinkcomplexity.pdf)
- [Problems on Algorithms, 2nd edition, by Ian Parberry and William Gasarch](http://larc.unt.edu/ian/books/free/poa.pdf)

Typically, for an internship or your first job, questions won't get much more specific unless you're applying for a specific role.  For example, if I wanted to be a mobile intern, I might be asked iOS/Android/Windows Phone specific questions, or if I wanted to be a web intern, I might be asked HTML/CSS/JavaScript questions, or if I wanted to be a backend intern, I might be asked about Django or Node or Ruby on Rails.  That definitely depends on the company, and what you're both looking for.

## Selling Them

When you're actively emailing and speaking with recruiters, they're going to ask you a lot of questions that are just checkboxes for what they're looking for in terms of skills.

If you've written anything in a language before, **put it on your resume**.  A lot of companies have parsers that look for specific things that, again, will put a tick on those checkboxes before putting you through to the next round of review.  Now, if you've only ever done "Hello, world!" in Python, don't say that you're a Python ninja or whatever.  You don't want to be thrown into an interview that will only hurt your self-confidence.  Speaking from experience.  Trust me.

When a recruiter or engineer is asking you about a certain project you've done, or how you've used a particular language, be as specific as possible.  Tell them **exactly** what you did on that particular project (or internship or what have you).  Tell them how much you contributed, what languages you used, how long was the duration of development for that project, what was the outcome of the project, etc. etc.

For example, don't say, "I'm the webmaster for a club website. Next question."  Okay, Dwight Schrute.  Go back to your beet farm.  Instead, say something more like this: "I developed and currently maintain the website for my university's computer science club. I built it from the ground up with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery on the front-end.  It's a static site, so a backend wasn't needed.  The website's main function is to promote the club and give members crucial updates about meetings and events, and I update it regularly via a Python script I wrote."  Oh my, you enchanting software engineer, you.  Let me hire you.

When you're talking to companies about specific things you've done, make sure they know:
- **What?** - What did you make?  What does it do?  What impact has it made?
- **Why?** - Why did you make it?  Was it for a hackathon, a school project, an open source contribution, or something else?
- **How?** - With which technologies did you make this?  Did you use a specific API?  What parts of it did you work on?
- **When?** - Did you do this recently or are you still living off of when you peaked in 10th grade?
- **Who?** - Did you work on this with anyone?  Who did what?  Who is this for?

Your skills are something that you have, and the reason why you have them is because you've used them in some way.  All you have to do to prove yourself is to explain yourself!  No need to go overboard and brag.  Just be honest, and confident.

# Your Search

You have a resume and cover letter in hand, and you have the skills to make anyone want you.  Now, you just have to find the right gig for you.

## Events

When you're on the hunt for a great internship or first job, the events you go to can really set you apart, and will help you meet people that could potentially help you in the long run.

The biggies that you will definitely run into are:
- Hackathons
- Meetups
- Conferences

So, how do you find these events?  They're happening all the time, you just need to know where to look.  Firstly, ask people in the field.  Talk to a mentor, a fellow student, a professor, a colleague... anyone could come through for you!  I remember my first tech event I went to in college was because I ran into a guy that I met orientation day.  And now he and I are coworkers.  Fancy that.  Anyway, people can get you very far.

Otherwise, when people don't work, we always have the glorious internet leading the way.  There's so many resources out there I definitely can't list them all.  So I'll list just a few.
- [Meetup](meetup.com) - Meetup is a great place to find groups of people who are interested in the same things you are, who meet regularly.  Look for engineering meetups that are hosted **at** companies.  You'll get to see an office, and meet people who actually work there (in addition to those who might work at other organizations).
- [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/) - Eventbrite is best for finding events that aren't recurring.  You can often find workshops, networking events, parties, and classes there.  I tend to just search for the term, "tech" or "computer" and the results simply flow.  Like a babbling brook.  Or something.
- [Major League Hacking](https://mlh.io/) - MLH provides a fairly thorough schedule of university hackathons every semester.  Most of the events on their schedule provide travel reimbursement, but there's so many that you'll likely find one near you!
- [Lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/) - Lanyrd is a "social conference directory" that is full of conferences based on almost any topic.  Follow your favorite speakers or search for a particular language or technology, and you'll be set.

## Networking

## Fellowships
Fellowships are a great way to network with a community and get valuable mentorship that will most certainly help you in the long run.  They vary depending on the program, but typically you'll get assigned a mentor or two, go to several events to network with professionals, and intern for a company that has partnered with the specific fellowship program.

Here's a list of some example fellowship programs.  This is by no means a complete list (feel free to send a pull request or file an issue if there's another you'd like to be added), but it should get you started!
